# CLAUDE.md — project memory for Repo2RLEnv

Auto-loaded by Claude Code for anyone working in this repo. It is **committed and
shared**, so it holds only what is true for any clone: architecture, invariants,
and the mistakes that are easy to make here.

It is not a changelog and not a contributor guide. Those live elsewhere:

| You want | Read |
|---|---|
| Dev setup, PR/commit conventions, code style, releases | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| Install → first dataset → push | [`docs/quickstart.md`](./docs/quickstart.md) |
| What each pipeline does, its yield and options | [`docs/pipelines/README.md`](./docs/pipelines/README.md) |
| Why a pipeline exists in its shape | [`docs/rfcs/`](./docs/rfcs/README.md) |
| Version history | [`docs/release_notes/HISTORY.md`](./docs/release_notes/HISTORY.md) |

If anything here conflicts with the code, **trust the code** and fix this file.

## What this is

**Repo2RLEnv** (`repo2rlenv` on PyPI) turns a repository into a verifiable RL
training/eval dataset. End-to-end: **synthesis → standardize → train + eval**,
focused on training. Datasets are emitted in the
[Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) task format so they drop
straight into Harbor's runtime ecosystem (Local Docker / Modal / Daytona / E2B /
Runloop + 22 agent harnesses).

GitHub: https://github.com/huggingface/Repo2RLEnv · PyPI: `repo2rlenv` · Apache-2.0.

Three layers, only the first is ours:

| Layer | We ship | We delegate |
|---|---|---|
| **Generation** (pipelines that produce tasks) | `src/repo2rlenv/pipelines/` — the moat | — |
| **Spec** (uniform output format) | `[metadata.repo2env]` extension to Harbor's `task.toml` | Harbor's task spec |
| **Consumption** (sandboxes / agents / runtime) | HF Hub publish bridge; planned TRL trainer bridge | Harbor's full stack |

## Invariants

Break these and the build, the CI, or the science breaks:

1. **Never `print()` in library or CLI code.** Everything goes through
   `repo2rlenv.ui.console` — see [UI conventions](#ui-conventions).
2. **Never hand-edit `pyproject.toml`'s `dependencies`.** Use `uv add <pkg>` /
   `uv add --dev <pkg>`, or it desyncs from `uv.lock`.
3. **Run `uv run pytest tests/test_pipeline_contract.py` after touching
   `pipelines/`.** It fails for any registered pipeline that breaks the Protocol.
4. **Anti-contamination is enforced by the environment, never requested in the
   prompt.** Native patch tasks use `pipelines/_env_guard.py`. Owned recipes use
   scrubbed build contexts, explicit Harbor network policies and fresh private
   verifiers; `execution/harbor_offline.py` is the tested single-container route
   for remote kernels without Harbor's dynamic firewall support. Don't add
   "please don't look up the fix" to an instruction — scrub the history and cut
   the egress instead.
5. **New pipeline ⇒ RFC first.** Any new `PipelineName` entry needs a
   `docs/rfcs/NNNN-*.md` before the implementation PR.
6. **New docs page ⇒ add it to a `docs/**/meta.json`** (usually `docs/meta.json`), or it
   won't appear in the site's sidebar. See `docs/contributing/DOCUMENTATION.md`.
7. **`from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module.**
8. **Version bumps never ride along in a feature PR** — they happen on `main`
   after merge, as their own commit.
9. **Don't commit generated artifacts.** Datasets go to the HF Hub; local run
   output stays gitignored.

## Pipelines

Registry: `pipelines/__init__.py:PIPELINES`. Names: `spec/input.py:PipelineName`.
Per-pipeline detail (yield, sources, options, reference datasets):
[`docs/pipelines/README.md`](./docs/pipelines/README.md).

| Pipeline | Shape | Status | RFC |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pr_diff` | text-only generation; thin Docker env for the 6-component diff-similarity reward | stable | 0001 |
| `pr_runtime` | mines PRs, verifies an F2P/P2P oracle in the bootstrap sandbox | stable | 0002 |
| `commit_runtime` | same, at commit level (bypasses PR-review filters) | stable | 0003 |
| `code_instruct` | LLM authors a problem + verifier anchored to real repo source | experimental | 0004 |
| `equivalence_tests` | extract a pure function; LLM writes tests against a `reference_<name>` oracle | experimental | 0005 |
| `cve_patches` | OSV CVE → fix commit → task; reuses the `pr_runtime` verifier | experimental | 0006 |
| `repo_mutate / swe_smith` | owned procedural source mutation and issue generation; separate Harbor verifier | experimental | 0012 |
| `terminal_synth / seta_seed2synth, tmax` | owned seed/skill-based terminal task generation | experimental | 0013, 0018 |
| `task_evolve / seta_evol` | evolve existing tasks with retained strategy prompts | experimental | 0014 |
| `pr_to_env / swe_gen` | supplied PRs, source reversal and execution-grounded instruction | experimental | 0015 |
| `repo_reconstruct / swe_flow` | traced dependency scheduling and missing-function reconstruction | experimental | 0016 |
| `equivalence_tests / r2e` | owned generate/execute/coverage loop and specification refinement | experimental | 0017 |
| `terminal_synth / endless_terminals, dataarc` | seedless terminal authoring and task evolution | experimental | 0020, 0022 |
| `terminal_reconstruct / terminalworld` | reconstruct tasks from public terminal recordings | experimental | 0019 |
| `env_repair / cli_gym` | invert a healthy environment and author a repair task | experimental | 0021 |
| `pr_runtime / swe_next` | mine supplied repository PR history and author repair tasks | experimental | 0023 |
| `commit_runtime / r2e_gym` | mine commit history and validate old/new behavior | experimental | 0024 |
| `reasoning_synth / scaler` | expand released problem families into reasoning instances | experimental | 0026 |

RFCs **0007 `pr_to_env` / 0008 `env_setup` / 0009 `test_synthesis` /
0010 `issue_runtime`** are drafted but not built.

Owned recipe integration follows RFC 0011 and method RFCs 0012–0026. Use
`repo2rlenv pipelines list` for implemented versus planned status. An export is
not quality acceptance: fresh execution, specification, attack and blind rollout
evidence must match its complete bundle hash. See `docs/pipelines/owned_recipes.md`.

Names follow `{source}_{shape}`:

- `_diff` — no sandbox at *generation* time. (`pr_diff` still emits a Docker env so
  its reward runs under `harbor`; "no sandbox" refers to generation, not consumption.)
- `_runtime` — runs inside the bootstrap sandbox to verify the oracle.
- `_patches` / `_instruct` / `_tests` — the artifact type, for synthesized pipelines.
- `_to_env` — import-shape: the caller supplies candidates, the pipeline doesn't
  mine them. The owned SWE-gen recipe uses this shape.

`_bugs` and `_synthesis` were retired with `mutation_bugs` / `refactor_synthesis`.

### The contract

```python
class Pipeline(Protocol):
    name: ClassVar[PipelineName]
    def __init__(self, input: GenerationInput, options: BaseModel) -> None: ...
    def run(self, out_dir: Path) -> PipelineResult: ...
```

## Local artifacts (all gitignored)

The tool writes everything under **`./workspace/`** by default; `--out` and
`R2E_CACHE_DIR` override it. Nothing there is committed, and it's all
regenerable — but at very different cost:

- **`workspace/bootstrap/`** — per-repo Docker env cache, content-addressed on the
  bootstrap options. Each entry costs real LLM spend (~$3–8/repo) to rebuild.
  Delete this last. Override with `R2E_CACHE_DIR`.
- **Dataset stagings** — cheap; the canonical copies live on the HF Hub and come
  back with `repo2rlenv pull`.
- **`harbor run` output, fetched diffs, agent transcripts** — free or cheap to re-fetch.

`plans/` and `references/` are also gitignored: internal working notes and shallow
clones of the inspiration repos (SWE-bench, SWE-smith, R2E-Gym, Magicoder, …). They
are per-developer and won't exist in a fresh clone — don't write code that assumes
either is present.

## UI conventions

```python
from repo2rlenv.ui import console

console.success("emitted task X")          # ✓ green
console.info("starting pipeline...")        # ⓘ cyan
console.warn("smoke gate exited 5")         # ⚠ yellow
console.error("docker daemon down")         # ✗ red
console.kv({"reward": 0.98, ...}, title="...")    # panel with key/value table
with console.section("Pushing to Hub"): ... # bracketed rule
```

For long-running work with a redrawing display, add a view under `ui/views/`:

```python
with BootstrapView(...) as view:
    ensure_bootstrap(..., on_turn=view.on_turn,
                          on_phase=view.on_phase,
                          on_thinking=view.on_thinking,
                          on_executing=view.on_executing)
    view.set_outcome(success=True, ...)
```

Logging routes through `RichHandler` via `install_logging()` (called from
`cli.py:main()`). Noisy loggers (litellm / httpx / anthropic / openai) are
auto-suppressed to WARNING while a Live is active.

## Input sources + auth

`--repo` accepts a GitHub `owner/name`, a `gitlab.com` URL, or a local path
(`/abs`, `./rel`, `~`, `file://`; on Windows also `C:\abs`, `.\rel`, UNC —
canonicalized to `file://<abspath>`).
`RepoSpec.source_kind` classifies it; `sources.py` defines a `Capability`
(pull_requests / issues / commit_api) per source and per pipeline's
`required_capabilities`. `cmd_generate` gates incompatible combinations up front —
e.g. `pr_diff` against a local path is refused with a clear error.

- Any source: `commit_runtime`, `code_instruct`, `equivalence_tests`
- GitHub **or** GitLab: `pr_diff`, `pr_runtime` (gitlab.com MRs via
  `gitlab.py`, dispatched by `provider.py`)
- GitHub only: `cve_patches` (needs OSV + the GitHub commit API)

`auth.resolve_repo_token()` dispatches by source: local → `None` (no `gh`
shell-out); gitlab → `repo.auth_token_env` then `$GITLAB_TOKEN`; github →
`resolve_github_token()`, which tries in order:

1. `repo.auth_token_env` env var (if set in config)
2. `gh auth token` (default — works for anyone who has run `gh auth login`)
3. `$GITHUB_TOKEN`
4. `None` (anonymous; fails on private repos)

HF Hub auth uses `huggingface_hub`'s own resolution
(`~/.cache/huggingface/token` or `$HF_TOKEN`). LLM keys come from provider-default
env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, …) via `auth.resolve_llm_api_key()` —
only for the providers in `auth.LLM_KEY_ENV_DEFAULTS`. Anything else is left to LiteLLM's
own lookup, and a self-hosted `LLMSpec.endpoint` (`--llm-endpoint`) needs no key at all
(`llm._resolve_api_key`).

Registry push credentials resolve from explicit env vars first: GHCR reads
`GHCR_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` (needs a one-time
`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s write:packages`); Docker Hub reads
`DOCKER_USERNAME` + `DOCKER_TOKEN` (a PAT — the credstore's OAuth token is
pull-only) and pushes under the Docker Hub *user's* namespace. ECR and Google AR
have their own modules. Multi-repo datasets push one image per repo and rewrite
each task to its own digest. Details: `docs/reference/REGISTRY_AUTH.md`; full env
var list: `docs/reference/ENV.md`.

## Cost tracking

`llm.complete()` returns `LLMResponse.cost_usd` via
`litellm.completion_cost(response)`, accumulated into
`AgentOutcome.total_cost_estimate_usd` and `BootstrapResult.llm_cost_estimate_usd`.
`BootstrapSpec.max_llm_spend_usd` is enforced inside `agent.py:run_agent_loop` —
at `total_cost ≥ max_spend_usd` the loop short-circuits with
`success=False, reason="cost budget exceeded: ..."`. The runner logs the budget at
startup.

Any change that adds LLM calls should thread cost through these fields rather than
introducing a parallel counter.

## Tests

`uv run pytest -q` is the canonical command; CI runs it on Python 3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14.
Conventions (fixtures over mocks, specific exception types, where files live) are in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md#tests). Two things worth knowing before you
debug a red run:

- **Some tests are opt-in and skip by default** — they need live network or
  credentials, and are gated behind env vars (`R2E_LIVE_PROBE_GHCR`,
  `R2E_E2E_HUB_BUILD`, `R2E_LIVE_GITLAB`). Skips here are expected.
- **`tests/test_e2e_public.py::test_e2e_public_trl` is flaky by construction.** It
  hits the live GitHub API and asserts that ≥1 task is emitted from the two most
  recent PRs on `huggingface/trl`, so it fails with
  `skip_reasons={'diff_too_small': N}` whenever those PRs happen to be small. That
  is not a regression — don't chase it.

## Design decisions

1. **No bind mounts for the bootstrap container** — the repo is `docker cp`'d in so
   `docker commit` captures it. Bind mounts are runtime overlays and aren't included
   in committed images. `bootstrap/docker.py:DockerSandbox.start`.
2. **Lenient smoke gate** — pytest exit codes 0, 1 and 5 all mean "env works"
   (1 = tests ran and failed; 5 = nothing collected). Only 2+ is a real env problem.
   `bootstrap/runner.py`.
3. **Test commands are joined with `&&`** — `test_cmds` runs as a single bash
   invocation so `export PATH=…` carries into the next command. Don't loop
   `sandbox.exec()` over the list.
4. **`registry_url` uses Harbor's legacy format** — we publish a `registry.json`
   that `harbor download --registry-url <url>` consumes directly, so no Harbor
   patches are needed.
5. **No `repo2rlenv run`, no parallel sandbox runtime** — running full tasks is
   `harbor run`'s job. This project is synthesis-only.
6. **Multi-repo datasets work in both push modes** — `inline` bakes each task's own
   bootstrap recipe from the verified `rebuild_cmds` (NOT the agent transcript);
   `registry` pushes each distinct image and rewrites each task to its digest.
   `push` clean-syncs `tasks/**` (a deleted task disappears from the Hub) and
   auto-writes `manifest.json`. Runtime pipelines ship
   `tests/{verifier.py,f2p.json,p2p.json}` as plain files — Harbor mounts `tests/`
   at `/tests`, so no base64 in `test.sh`.
7. **The environment enforces, the prompt never asks** — `_env_guard.py` scrubs git
   history back to `base_commit` and blackholes PyPI/GitHub egress for every emitted
   task, because a sandbox-verified task is otherwise gameable by fetching the
   published fix. Background: `docs/release_notes/HISTORY.md`.

## External dependencies

- **Harbor** (`uv tool install harbor`) — runs the generated tasks. We deliberately
  don't ship a parallel runtime.
- **Docker** — required for `bootstrap` and every `_runtime` pipeline. `pr_diff`
  *generates* without it, though its emitted task *runs* in Docker (thin
  `python:3.12-slim`); set `emit_harbor_env=False` for pure text output.
- **LiteLLM** — the single client across providers (Anthropic / OpenAI / HF Router /
  Bedrock / Ollama / vLLM).
- **Rich** — every CLI surface; foundation of `ui/`.
- **huggingface_hub** — dataset publish/pull.
- **`gh` CLI** — clone + PR listing; the least-friction GitHub auth path.

## Common commands

```bash
# Generate a sandbox-verified dataset (auto-triggers bootstrap if needed)
uv run repo2rlenv generate \
  --repo <owner>/<repo> --pipeline pr_runtime \
  --pipeline-opt limit=10 \
  --llm anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --out ./workspace/datasets/<name>

# Validate a dataset (fast structural check — no LLM, no Docker)
uv run repo2rlenv validate ./workspace/datasets/<name>
# ...plus task assets + reproducibility metadata (still static); --oracle adds solution/
uv run repo2rlenv validate ./workspace/datasets/<name> --deep

# Publish / retrieve (a bare name resolves its owner via whoami)
uv run repo2rlenv push ./workspace/datasets/<name> <org>/<name>
uv run repo2rlenv pull <org>/<name>

# Everything CI runs
uv run pytest -q && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .

# Dependencies
uv add <pkg>            # runtime
uv add --dev <pkg>      # dev only
```

## Status

Version is whatever `pyproject.toml` says (`__version__` reads package metadata).
Native pipelines and owned recipe families share the registry. Use `repo2rlenv pipelines list` for current availability; see
[`docs/release_notes/HISTORY.md`](./docs/release_notes/HISTORY.md) for how it got here.

Write for someone using or extending Repo2RLEnv. Describe the implemented behavior,
its limits and a runnable example. Put campaign diaries, provider receipts, budget
approvals and one-off input selections in ignored `workspace/` directories.

## How the site is built

The site is a [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev) app (Next.js, static export) in
`website/`. Content stays in `docs/`, so every page is also readable on GitHub and
paths such as `docs/pipelines/pr_runtime.md` stay stable. Published dataset cards
link to them.

```files
docs
├── meta.json            # sidebar: sections, order and cross-folder pages
├── quickstart.mdx       # .mdx pages may use components (Steps, Cards, Tabs, Film)
├── pipelines
│   ├── meta.json
│   └── pr_runtime.md    # .md pages are plain Markdown (keep these paths stable)
└── _tools               # generators (not pages)
website
├── app                  # routes: landing page, docs pages, search, llms.txt
├── components           # Film, Mermaid, link resolution
└── tools/check-links.mjs
```

## Build and preview

Requires Node.js 22+ and Python 3.12+. No model keys, cloud accounts or private
campaign directories are needed; the build reads source files as text and never
executes task code.

```bash
cd website
npm ci
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000, hot reload
npm run build                # static site in website/out
node tools/check-links.mjs   # every internal link and #anchor must resolve
node tools/check-tutorials.mjs # article metadata, discovery and feed coverage
```

`npm run dev` and `npm run build` first regenerate `docs/pipelines/prompts/` from
canonical templates and request-assembly code. That directory is ignored; edit the
canonical prompt or `docs/_tools/generate_prompt_reference.py`, never the generated
pages.

## Write a page

Every page starts with front matter; the site renders the title, so don't repeat it
as a `#` heading:

```yaml
---
title: "Run tasks with Harbor"
description: "One sentence that says what this page gets you."
film: pr-runtime   # optional: a live explainer film above the body
---
```

- Add the page to a `meta.json` (usually `docs/meta.json`) or it won't appear in the
  sidebar. Root entries may point into other folders (`"pipelines/quality_loop"`).
- Link with relative file paths (`../concepts/tasks.mdx`, `pr_runtime.md#options`);
  links to non-page files open on GitHub.
- In `.md` files use Markdown only: GitHub alerts (`> [!NOTE]`), ```` ```files ````
  trees, ```` ```mermaid ```` diagrams and `tab="…"` code tabs all render on the site.
- In `.mdx` files you can also use `<Steps>`, `<Cards>`, `<Tabs>`, `<Callout>` and
  `<Film id="…" />`. Escape `<` and `{` in prose.

Each pipeline guide should explain its inputs, show one stage diagram, map model
calls to their inputs and outputs, and describe verification and bounded repair.
Link to canonical prompts, upstream credits, measured economics and the dataset.
Keep shared execution and quality contracts in their common guides and RFCs.

## Publish a tutorial

Tutorials live in `docs/tutorials/` and use the existing static docs renderer,
search index and social-image generator. Add the article to `tutorials/meta.json`
and include this metadata alongside its title and description:

```yaml
tutorial:
  author:
    name: "Your name"
    url: "https://github.com/your-handle"
  published: "2026-09-30"
  testedVersion: "0.9.3"
```

Add `updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"` only when the article changes meaningfully; it controls
the visible update date, Article structured data and sitemap modification date.
The landing page and `/tutorials/feed.xml` list tutorial articles automatically.
The full text also enters site search and the Markdown/LLM exports. All files in
this content tree are public at deployment; keep unfinished drafts in ignored
`workspace/` until they are ready for a PR.

For an illustrated thumbnail, place a PNG in `website/public/images/tutorials/`
and set `tutorial.thumbnail` with `src` (the `/images/tutorials/…png` URL), `alt`,
`width` and `height`. It appears on the tutorial card, article and social previews.
Keep text in the page title rather than embedding it in the artwork, and record
generated artwork's prompt and tool in that asset directory's README.

Write around a reader's outcome and a specific supported path. Verify commands
against the named package version, keep maintained options in `examples/tutorials/`,
and distinguish historical measurements, illustrative examples and newly executed
runs. Budget values are limits, not price estimates. Include diagrams with a text
explanation and review the rendered page on mobile. Author names and dates must
match the visible byline and structured data.

After the static build, check internal links and tutorial metadata/feed integrity.
After deployment, inspect the public page and its canonical URL, confirm the
sitemap includes it, then use an authorized Search Console account to submit the
sitemap and request indexing. Deployment and a sitemap make content discoverable;
search engines decide whether and when to index it. See
[Google's article guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/article).

## Update measured results

Review the evidence and update `docs/data/pipelines.json` for cohort/yield definitions,
`docs/data/experiment-economics.json` for scoped ledger, model, token and resource
accounting, and `docs/data/frontiersmith-campaign.json` for that collection. Then run:

```bash
python3 docs/_tools/generate_metrics.py
python3 docs/_tools/generate_metrics.py --check
```

Keep only sanitized measurements, source fingerprints and public dataset revisions
in these files. Count retries under their candidate identity, separate retained tasks, and
keep generation, quality evaluation and solver outcomes distinct. Costs must
name their sample and include failures; unavailable compute or yield is not zero.
Keep raw evidence locally or with an appropriate dataset/release artifact.
The generator checks stage/model sums, unknown-call holds and shared-cost scopes.
Never add a parent budget transfer to its child spending, or add pilot and expansion
subsets to an already inclusive program total. The generated
[accounting detail](../pipelines/experiment_accounting.md) records these boundaries.

The economics and native-results pages set `resultsVisual: economics` or
`resultsVisual: native` in front matter. Their charts in
`website/components/results-visuals.tsx` read the same measurement JSON as the
tables. Keep shared compute pooled, show missing yield as unknown, and label
nested oracle gates as cumulative conditions. The Markdown tables remain the
portable source for readers on GitHub. Check each chart in light/dark mode and
on a narrow screen; visible values must explain it without hover or colour.
At phone widths, wide comparison tables and diagrams scroll inside their own
containers. Diagrams fit the screen first and expand to their readable intrinsic
width on request. Allow page actions
to wrap, and use `min-width: 0` and explicit grid columns for flexible cards.
Check the home page, a pipeline guide and both results pages at 320px, 390px,
768px and desktop widths. The document itself must not scroll horizontally.

The GitHub action in both layouts reads the public repository API in the browser,
caches a successful count for one hour, and animates it unless reduced motion is
requested. No API key or build-time network request is needed. On failure it
keeps a timestamped cached count, or an em dash if none exists; the repository
link remains usable. Do not hard-code a star count into a release.

Historical native-pipeline records live in the same file under `native_history`.
Preserve their evidence scope: a cached inventory, a generation-time verification
stamp and a Harbor oracle gate are different observations. Do not carry a gate
from an older cohort onto a newer dataset. The old synthesis counters are
run-cumulative; sum one final counter per run, not every exported task's counter.
Update [native results](../pipelines/native_results.md) when changing those
measurements, and retain source hashes or pinned public manifests.

## Explainer films

The films on pipeline pages are live [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev) compositions
from the hf-motion repository, played in the browser so they follow the site's light
and dark themes. They are vendored as one module in `website/vendor/films/`; rebuild
and copy it from hf-motion when a film changes.

## Review changes

Check the stage diagram against the implementation, validate example configs and
build the site from a clean checkout. CI regenerates the prompt reference, checks the
metrics tables, builds the site, checks every internal link and anchor, and fails if
the build changed tracked files. Inspect changed diagrams in a browser, in light and
dark mode. Preserve upstream notices and source pins when condensing a guide or RFC.

title: "Pipeline RFCs"
---

Design docs for new synthesis pipelines. One RFC per pipeline. Written **before** the code lands; kept in the repo after the pipeline ships as a permanent record of *why* the pipeline exists in the shape it does.

## Why RFCs

A pipeline is 100–300 LOC of code, but the decisions behind it (repo shape it fits, verification approach, contamination story, LLM use, yield expectations) are much harder to reconstruct from a merged diff months later. Every new pipeline in this repo has had non-obvious design choices (issue-fetch fallback in `commit_runtime`, PoC-agent for `cve_patches`, anti-contamination compose overlay, graded vs. binary reward). Those choices deserve a durable home separate from the implementation.

An RFC also front-loads the audit: writing the "how does contamination get in?" section forces you to think about it *before* you've shipped 100 published envs.

## When to write one

- **Always** for a new pipeline (new entry in `PipelineName`).
- **Optional** for meaningful reshapes of an existing pipeline (e.g. adding LLM synthesis to `commit_runtime` in v0.8.4, retrospectively RFC-worthy).
- **Skip** for polish / bug-fix work that fits in a PR description.

**Retrospective RFCs.** Pipelines that shipped before this process existed (RFCs 0001–0006) have RFCs written *after* their initial merge, as archival records. They're `status: implemented` from day one and their [Implementation](#lifecycle) sections link back to the initial PR, source file, doc page, and reference dataset. Retro RFCs are lighter on the "alternatives considered" front (memory decays) and heavier on cross-referencing the current authoritative doc (`docs/pipelines/<name>.md`) as the source of truth. Do not write retro RFCs for pipelines that have been withdrawn (`mutation_bugs`, `refactor_synthesis`). Git history is enough.

## Process

1. **Pick a candidate** from [`plans/candidate_pipelines.md`](https://github.com/huggingface/Repo2RLEnv/blob/main/plans/candidate_pipelines.md), or propose a new one.
2. **Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md)** to `docs/rfcs/NNNN-<name>.md` (next unused 4-digit number, kebab-case name).
3. **Fill in every section:** write "n/a" if a section genuinely doesn't apply, don't just delete it. If you don't know an answer yet, mark it `TBD` and open it in "Open questions."
4. **PR the RFC alone** first: reviews want to look at the design without the implementation blur. RFCs at this stage should carry the label `rfc:draft` (add it via `gh pr edit --add-label rfc:draft`).
5. **Iterate on the RFC** based on review. Update the status header as it moves through the lifecycle (see below).
6. **Once accepted**, implement the pipeline in a follow-up PR that references the RFC number and follows [`docs/contributing/ADDING_A_PIPELINE.md`](../contributing/ADDING_A_PIPELINE.md).
7. **After merge**, update the RFC's status to `implemented`, add the merge commit + PR link, and link the reference dataset from the "Rollout" section.

## Lifecycle

RFCs have a `Status:` header line that moves through these states:

- `draft`: being written; not yet ready for design review.
- `review`: ready for feedback; PR open.
- `accepted`: design signed off; implementation can begin.
- `implemented`: code has landed on `main`. RFC is now archival.
- `withdrawn`: decided against. Kept for posterity; explain why in a final "Withdrawal" section.
- `superseded`: replaced by a later RFC (link both directions).

## Numbering

Sequential. `0001-<name>.md`, `0002-<name>.md`, …. Never reuse a number. If an RFC is withdrawn, the number is retired with it.

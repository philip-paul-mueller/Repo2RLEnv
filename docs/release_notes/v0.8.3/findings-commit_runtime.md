title: "commit_runtime: filter / leak / artifact fixes + 52-env reference dataset (Arc 3)"
---

This release sharpens `commit_runtime` end-to-end and ships **52 oracle-verified environments** as the reference dataset. Kept **experimental** for now: the underlying mining problem (commits without linked issues yield thinner instructions than PRs do) hasn't fully gone away, but every other lever has been pulled.

## Published dataset

**<https://huggingface.co/datasets/AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-commit-runtime>** (added to the [Verifiable RL Environments](https://huggingface.co/collections/AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-verifiable-rl-environments) collection).

- **52 environments**, all oracle-verified (`reward == 1.0` with the gold patch).
- Resolution split: **52 `resolved`** (tracked SWE-bench-style) · **47 `command_resolved`** (clean test command) · **47 `eval_grade`** (`command_resolved` + non-empty P2P regression guard).
- 12 source repos: `urfave/cli` 15 · `gin-gonic/gin` 8 · `pallets/click` 7 · `gorilla/mux` 6 · `python-attrs/attrs` 4 · `stretchr/testify` 3 · `spf13/cobra` 3 · `pocketbase/pocketbase` 2 · `pallets/werkzeug` · `encode/httpx` · `sirupsen/logrus` · `psf/requests` (1 each).
- **Go-heavy by design.** See Audit § Repo skew below.
- Same shape as the `pr_runtime` reference dataset (manifest with per-task build/oracle status + checksums + dataset commit; plain `tests/verifier.py` + `tests/f2p.json` + `tests/p2p.json` artifacts; inline `environment/Dockerfile` from public bases).

## What changed

`commit_runtime` already reuses `pr_runtime`'s validation harness, so most of Arc 2's wins came along for free. Arc 3 was about everything **upstream** of validation (the mining filters and the instruction text) plus one critical Arc-2 inheritance bug.

### 1. Non-bugfix conventional-commit-type rejection

Before Arc 3, `_CC_PREFIX_RE` only *stripped* the conventional-commit type from a subject. So `chore: bump version`, `docs: typo`, `feat: add X`, `refactor: rename Y`, `style: black format`, `test: cover Z`, `ci: pin actions`, `build: drop py3.10`, `perf: hot loop`, and `revert: …` all sailed past the filter, got bootstrapped, and burned validation cycles before finally getting rejected at the F2P stage. The new `_NON_BUG_TYPE_RE` returns `non_bugfix_type` from `_metadata_filter` for those, mirroring `pr_runtime._NON_BUG_TITLE_RE`.

### 2. Bugfix positive-signal filter

A commit with no type prefix had no positive bugfix signal either, so plain-subject feature commits ("Update README", "Improve performance") slipped through. Now `_metadata_filter` requires at least one of:

- `fix:` prefix
- A `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` issue trailer
- A bugfix keyword in the subject (`fix` / `bug(fix|s)?` / `regression` / `crash(ed|ing)?` / `broken` / `incorrect(ly)?` / `wrong(ly)?` / `fail(s|ed|ing|ure)?` / `defect` / `hotfix` / `patch(ed)?`)

### 3. Issue-fetch fallback for the instruction

The biggest single quality lever, ported from Arc 2's PR-body leak fix. Commit messages routinely name the function being fixed ("Fix off-by-one in `Pager.advance`"), describe the fix approach, and link to companion fix-PRs or commit SHAs. The bug **report** doesn't usually do any of that.

When a commit has `Closes #N`, `build_instruction_from_commit` now fetches the issue body (`github.fetch_issue`, same path `pr_runtime` uses) and renders that as the problem statement. Commits without a linked issue fall back to the commit subject + body, run through `_strip_info_leak` and `_reflow_pr_body`. The smoke test on `pallets/click` showed the first emitted task's instruction came verbatim from the GitHub issue, not the commit message, which is exactly the design.

### 4. Solution-leak strip + extended patterns

Imported `_strip_info_leak` from `pr_runtime` and applied it to commit subject + body. Plus two new patterns covering the audit's residual soft leaks:

- **Trailing `(#NNNN)` squash trailers:** Pallets/Werkzeug/Flask/httpx all squash-merge PRs with `(#1234)` appended to the subject; that's a direct lookup back to the merged fix.
- **Cross-repo issue refs without a closes keyword** (`gorilla#739` style): the existing `_LEAK_PATTERNS` only caught the `owner/repo#N` form when paired with a closes keyword.

Both shared with `pr_runtime` since the patterns are universally applicable.

### 5. Body reflow

Ported `_reflow_pr_body` (drop HTML template comments, stop at checklist headers, collapse blank runs, length cap). Commit bodies can be just as verbose as PR bodies, especially when authors paste in CI output or sign-off lines.

### 6. `reward_calibration` stamping (parity with `pr_runtime`)

Emitted tasks now carry `[metadata.repo2env.reward_calibration]` with `f2p_count`, `p2p_count`, `source_files`, `loc_changed`, and a bucketed `difficulty`, and the `HarborTask.difficulty` is set from the bucket rather than the hard-coded `"medium"`. The launch-side manifest enricher (`plans/build_enriched_manifest.py`) reads these to compute the `eval_grade` flag without re-parsing the diff.

### 7. The critical bug: emit graded `test.sh` + plain artifacts (Arc 2 inheritance miss)

Arc 2 refactored `pr_runtime` to ship `tests/{verifier.py,f2p.json,p2p.json}` as plain task artifacts and to call them from `test.sh`. `commit_runtime` never inherited that: it called `pr_runtime.build_eval_script` *without* `fail_to_pass` / `pass_to_pass`, which falls back to the binary exit-code path. Result: emitted `test.sh` only wrote `reward.txt` (binary 1.0/0.0), `reward.json` was **never** written, and `tracked` / `command_resolved` / the full F2P/P2P breakdown were silently lost across the whole dataset.

Two fixes:

- Pass `fail_to_pass=…, pass_to_pass=…` to `build_eval_script` so the graded path triggers.
- Pass `aux_files=_runtime_aux_files(fail_to_pass, pass_to_pass)` to the emitted `HarborTask` so the three artifacts ship with the task dir.

The oracle gate caught this immediately: `0/56 reward.json` files on the first run vs `52/52 reward.json` after the fix.

## Validation evidence

Full 100-task-style oracle gate run on the 52-env dataset:

- **52/52 tracked-resolved** (gold patch always satisfies the F2P+P2P sets: the oracle invariant).
- **47/52 command_resolved.** The 5 that aren't: 3× `spf13/cobra` (one untracked failure each: sibling test in the same file that the gold patch doesn't touch) + 2× `stretchr/testify` (22 untracked failures each: Go-subtest parser over-counts; see Limitations below).
- **47/52 eval_grade.** All 47 `command_resolved` tasks also have `p2p_count > 0`, so `eval_grade` matches `command_resolved` exactly on this dataset.

A separate qualitative audit on 9 stratified tasks (one per repo, eval_grade + edge cases): **5/9 gold-standard** (clean issue body sourced from GitHub, well-scoped F2P/P2P, real source fix), **3/9 mediocre** (thin commit-message-fallback instructions when no linked issue), **1/9 weak** (270-char title-only prompt, also one of the 4 broken-oracle tasks that was dropped pre-publish). The mediocre tail is the structural commit-runtime limitation, not a fixable bug.

**4 broken-oracle tasks dropped** from the 56 generated: `psf__requests-6404f3`, `stretchr__testify-15f682`, `urfave__cli-195aaf`, `urfave__cli-b4f42d`. All scored 0.97-0.999 on the gold patch: single flaky P2P each, same shape as Arc 2's `urfave__cli-2290`/`TestCompletionShell`. Could be salvaged with the same flaky-P2P prune Arc 2 used; left for a future polish pass.

## Limitations

- **Thin instructions when no linked issue.** ~30% of tasks have no `Closes #N` and fall back to the commit subject + body. When the commit subject is a one-liner ("Fix RFC 2069 mode digest authentication"), the agent has very little to work with. This is the structural difference vs `pr_runtime` and the reason `commit_runtime` stays experimental.
- **Go-subtest parser over-counts untracked failures.** The verifier's Go-test log parser treats each subtest line as a tracked test, so when a subtest fails inside a non-F2P parent the count of "untracked failed" balloons (22 for `stretchr/testify` even though the test command exited 0). Affects `command_resolved` / `eval_grade` flagging only; `resolved` and the graded `reward` are correct. Subtest-aware grouping is a follow-up.
- **Lower yield on PR-driven repos.** Pallets/Werkzeug/Flask/httpx all merge-commit their PRs; `commit_runtime` correctly rejects those merge commits and yields ~0 directly mineable bugfix commits. Use `pr_runtime` for those repos. That's its turf.
- **Go-heavy reference dataset.** 39/52 envs are Go (urfave/gin/mux/cobra/testify/logrus) because Go projects in the bootstrap-cached set commit directly + squash-merge more than the Python projects do. This isn't a `commit_runtime` defect. It's the pipeline's natural fit shining through. Documented up-front for any eval that wants language balance.
- **No `commit_stream` continuous variant.** Same call as Arc 2: if continuous mining ever becomes a hard requirement, it's flags on `commit_runtime` (`since=auto` + `state-file=…`), not a separate pipeline.
